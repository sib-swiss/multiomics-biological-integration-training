These TFs are encoded on various chromosomes, with no single chromosome dominating the process—development involves distributed genetic networks across the genome.\n\n### Hindbrain\n\n#### Major TFs and genes at E11.5–E15.5\n\nGBX2 (posterior hindbrain vs. midbrain boundary), HOX genes (rhombomere patterning, e.g., Hoxa/b clusters), PAX3 (dorsal hindbrain), KROX20 (rhombomeres 3/5), FGF8 (isthmus), EN1/EN2 (overlapping midbrain), IRX genes, dynamic enhancers in cerebellar primordium.\n\n#### Important chromosomes (examples of key genes):\n\n```\nChr1: En1\nChr2: Gbx2\n```\n\n#### At E11.5: Rhombomere segmentation strong; floor plate and roof plate signaling.\n\n#### At E15.5: Cerebellar rhombic lip and ventricular zone progenitors active; many enhancers shared with midbrain/forebrain but some hindbrain-specific.\n\nThis project focuses on E11.5 and E15.5 hindbrain samples. WGBS should be treated as an observation-level assay (CpG-level methylation proportions with coverage) and represented as BSseq/GenomicRatioSet or a CpG BED with methylation and coverage prior to integration. Students will integrate RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, WGBS, and histone modification (H3K4me3, H3K27ac, H3K27me3, H3K4me1) data to identify regulatory programs and epigenomic changes during hindbrain development. Deliverables: an analysis report, figures highlighting differential expression/peaks/methylation, and a short presentation.\n\n\n## Available data\n\nData has been downloaded and prepared for you from [Mouse Development Matrix: Hindbrain](https://www.encodeproject.org/mouse-development-matrix/?type=Experiment&status=released&related_series.@type=OrganismDevelopmentSeries&replicates.library.biosample.organism.scientific_name=Mus+musculus#hindbrain)\n\n\nStudents should download project data (group projects) from:\nhttps://multiomics-biological-integration-training.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/project3.tar.gz\n\nSetup in R\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Download and extract project3 data into a folder named 'project3'\nurl <- \"https://multiomics-biological-integration-training.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/project3.tar.gz\"\ndest <- \"project3.tar.gz\"\ndownload.file(url, dest, mode = \"wb\")\nutils::untar(dest, exdir = \"project3\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nAfter extracting, a directory project3 appears with the following content:\n\n```\n.\n├── ATAC_11half.bw\n├── ATAC_15half.bw\n├── atac_se.rds\n├── H3K27ac_11half.bw\n├── H3K27ac_15half.bw\n├── h3k27ac_se.rds\n├── H3K27me3_11half.bw\n├── H3K27me3_15half.bw\n├── h3k27me3_se.rds\n├── H3K4me1_11half.bw\n├── H3K4me1_15half.bw\n├── h3k4me1_se.rds\n├── H3K4me3_11half.bw\n├── H3K4me3_15half.bw\n├── h3k4me3_se.rds\n├── rna_se.rds\n├── WGBS_11half.bed.gz\n└── WGBS_15half.bed.gz\n```\n\n```\n├─ rna_se.rds — SummarizedExperiment for RNA-seq (gene counts / normalized expression)\n├─ atac_se.rds — SummarizedExperiment for ATAC-seq (peak counts / accessibility)\n├─ h3k4me3_se.rds, h3k27ac_se.rds, h3k4me1_se.rds, h3k27me3_se.rds — SummarizedExperiments for histone marks (peak-level assays)\n├─ *.bw (e.g., H3K4me3_11half.bw, ATAC_15half.bw) — bigWig signal tracks for visualization\n├─ WGBS_11half.bed.gz, WGBS_15half.bed.gz — CpG-level methylation (columns typically: chr, start, end, methylation_prop, coverage); treat as observation assay\n```\n\nThe provided assay objects are `RangedSummarizedExperiment` (assay names: \"counts\", \"logCPM\") with `rowRanges` as `GRanges` and `colData` including sample/group fields; differential analyses have already been performed and are reflected in the supplied objects. Students should therefore focus on interpretation and integrative analysis rather than re-running DE tests.\n\n\n\n## Day 1\n\n- Explore the dataset for the project:\n\n  - How many samples are there?\n  - Is the data properly normalized?\n  - How about a volcano plot to visualize the differences?\n  - How many chromosomes are present in the data?\n  \n- ATAC-seq data\n\n  - How many peaks are there?\n  - How many differentially accessible peaks are there between E11.5 and E15.5?\n  - What is the median width of the ATAC peaks?\n  \n- Normalizing and plotting\n\n  - Use correct normalization method for each dataset.\n  - Can you divide the `EnrichedHeatmap` for increse and decrease in accessibility regions?\n  - How about also dividng `EnrichedHeatmap` for different annotations?\n\n- ChIP-seq data\n  \n  - How many peaks are there for each histone mark?\n  - How many differentially enriched peaks are there between E11.5 and E15.5 for each mark?\n  - What is the median width of the peaks for each mark?\n  \n- RNA-seq data\n\n  - How many genes are there?\n  - How many differentially expressed genes are there between E11.5 and E15.5?\n  - **Gene Expression Boxplots:** For key hindbrain transcription factors such as `GBX2` and `KROX20`, create boxplots showing their normalized expression levels across samples for E11.5 and E15.5. Analyze and interpret the observed expression changes.\n\n\n## Day 2\n\n- `overlapMatrix`\n\n  - As done during the course exercise, make the `overlapMatrix` for your data.\n  - Similar to [Exercise 5](https://sib-swiss.github.io/multiomics-biological-integration-training/day2/day2-2_atac_rna.html), find different regions of activity in your data.\n  \n- Integrative analysis\n  - Can you identify enhancers in the data?\n  - Are there any repressed promoters?\n  - Can you identify regions with increased chromatin accessibility, increased H3K27ac and H3K4me3, increased gene expression and which are less than 2.kb of TSS? what would you call these regions?\n\n## Day 3\n\n- Enrichment analysis\n  - Can you find any enriched GO terms in the Gained Enhancer regions in E15.5 compared to E11.5?\n  - Can you find any enriched GO terms in the Repressed Promoter regions in E15?\n  - What biological significant GO terms did you find in these regions? Do they make sense in the context of development?\n\n\n## Advanced analysis\n- For En2, which category applies (e.g., Silent at E15.5)?\n- Obtain `overlapMatrix` from other brain region from your colleagues.\n- Merge `overlapMatrices` from all three regions to compare co-occurring signals.\n- Generate shared vs. unique regulatory regions (e.g., Venn diagram of gained enhancers).\n- Are there region-specific regulatory programs distinguishing forebrain/midbrain/hindbrain projects?\n",
