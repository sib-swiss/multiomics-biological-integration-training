## Roles & organisation

Project based learning is about learning by doing, but also about *peer instruction*. This means that you will be both a learner and a teacher. There will be differences in levels among participants, but because of that, some will learn efficiently from people that have just learned, and others will teach and increase their understanding.

Each project has hints and guiding questions. However, if interesting questions pop up during the project, you are **encouraged** to work on those. Also, you don't have to perform all the tasks and answer all the questions.

You will get to know each other, define how you like to collaborate and start on the project. You can work on the project, and apply the skills and knowledge you have learned during these days. We will conclude the projects on day 3 with a **10-minute presentation** of each group.

## Working directories

Each group has access to a shared working directory, which is mounted at the root level as `/group_work/groupX` (replace `X` with your group number). 

In RStudio-server, you can view the contents of your group's directory in the `Files pane` (bottom left). Click on the three dots (`...`) to navigate to `/group_work/groupX` and access or manage your project files.
